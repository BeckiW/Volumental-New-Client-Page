# Creating a feature page for one of Volumental's clients - New Balance

Challenge from the fast growing start-up Volumental to improve an important part of their webpage â€“ their client pages. 

Volumentalâ€™s mission is to transform the footwear industry, enabling a completely personalised experience in fitting and finding the perfect footwear. Volumental combines the world's fastest high accuracy 3D foot scanning system for retail, with an advanced AI driven 'Fit Engine' that generates highly personalised footwear recommendations.

Developed in Stockholm, Sweden, the Volumental solution drives sales, increases customer satisfaction and provides detailed data for research and development. Working with partners such as New Balance, Bauer and Ecco, the Volumental scanning solution is used across the globe.

Currently their customers are listed on a [single page website.](https://www.volumental.com/partners/) Once the customer portfolio grows they would like to create separate feature pages for their biggest clients. The task was to create a stand alone page for the Volumental website dedicated to one of their customers in this case **New Balance**
